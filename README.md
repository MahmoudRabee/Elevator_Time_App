# Elevator Timer App
Welcome to the Elevator Timer App, the only app you need to determine whether it's the right time to use the elevator in Egypt!

## How it Works
The Elevator Timer App is simple to use. Just open the app and you'll be taken to the main page, where you'll see a timer counting down to the next available time slot for using the elevator. This page will also display a funny GIF to keep you entertained while you wait.

Once the timer reaches zero, you'll be able to use the elevator and the app will display a message letting you know that it's elevator time! But if the timer is still counting down, you'll need to wait a little longer before you can use the elevator.

If you try to use the elevator outside of the designated time slot, the app will take you to a second page that displays a sad GIF and a message letting you know that it's not elevator time right now. But don't worry, the timer will reset and you can try again later!
